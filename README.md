# Udacity ND104 Bikeshare

Created June 17th, 2019

## About the Project

This project was created as a part of the Udacity Nanodegree program "Programming for Data Science".

This interactive script explores the data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Based on the selection of city data, the user is then able to get information such as most common route info, user statistics, and popular times of travel.
